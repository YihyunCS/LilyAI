# LilyAI - From Rug Pull to Real Potential ðŸŒŸ

## Introduction

LilyAI was originally launched with the promise of becoming a customizable AI agent platform, but it fell short of delivering on its vision. The initial project lacked transparency, proper execution, and ultimately turned into a rug pull that hurt many in the community. We want to address this directly and take responsibility for reviving the project in a way that prioritizes transparency, functionality, and community trust.

Our goal is to rebuild LilyAI into a legitimate and useful platform that empowers users with customizable AI capabilities while establishing a fair and sustainable ecosystem.

## The New Vision for LilyAI

LilyAI will be transformed into a scriptable AI agent platform, enabling users to:

- **Customize AI behavior** by adding their own scripts tailored to specific tasks.
- **Access a marketplace** for pre-built scripts created by developers from around the world.
- **Use the LilyAI token** for marketplace transactions, premium features, and community governance.

This time, we're committed to making it real. Hereâ€™s how:

### Whatâ€™s Different Now

#### Full Transparency

- All development will be open-source and conducted on this GitHub repository.
- Smart contracts and platform code will be publicly auditable to ensure no hidden traps.

#### Fair Tokenomics

- Weâ€™re redesigning the token system to ensure fair distribution, with no unfair founder allocations or hidden mechanics.
- Victims of the original rug pull will receive compensation in the form of airdropped tokens.

#### Community-First Approach

- Regular updates and communication with the community.
- Governance mechanisms that allow token holders to vote on platform improvements and roadmap decisions.

## Key Features of LilyAI

- **Scriptable AI Agents:** Users can create and deploy AI agents by adding custom scripts to meet their needs.
- **Marketplace for AI Scripts:** Developers can share or sell their scripts, and users can discover and implement them with ease.
- **Blockchain Integration:**
  - Use LilyAI tokens for transactions, subscriptions, and governance.
  - Transparent and secure transactions through smart contracts.
- **Open API:** Developers can integrate LilyAI into their own apps and workflows.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation Building

- Develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for scriptable AI agents.

### Phase 2: Marketplace and Token Integration

- Launch the AI script marketplace.
- Integrate LilyAI tokens for transactions and governance.

We deeply regret the events surrounding the original rug pull and recognize the damage it caused to the community. This revival is not just about restoring trust but also about turning an unfortunate event into a meaningful and impactful project.
